UTLZ-1#1 Error
Resource utilization  - PBlock:ROOT
LUT as Distributed RAM over-utilized in Top Level Design (This design requires more LUT as Distributed RAM cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 16432 of such cell types but only 9600 compatible sites are available in the target device. Please analyze your synthesis results and constraints to ensure the design is mapped to Xilinx primitives as expected. If so, please consider targeting a larger device. Please set tcl parameter "drc.disableLUTOverUtilError" to 1 to change this error to warning.)ROOT
Related violations: <none>

UTLZ-1#2 Error
Resource utilization  - PBlock:ROOT
LUT as Memory over-utilized in Top Level Design (This design requires more LUT as Memory cells than are available in the target device. This design requires 16435 of such cell types but only 9600 compatible sites are available in the target device.
